# Block Bros Ultimate

This is a **2D PVP Shooter** based on the concept of combining 2 genres such as fighting and fps.
I tried to collude smash bros and COD into a fun game that can be played with a local friend. 
The game was made in Unity and has the following features:
- Smooth player movement designed for fast paced action
- 4 Unique guns with different fire & reload rates
- PS4 Controller Support for enhanced gameplay 'feel'
- Local Couch Coop
- Basic UI and Aimations

This game was designed with Scalable Code Architecture for future Online Multiplayer expansion.
Currently, the plan is to polish the game in the next month and then port it onto the Android/iOS Market
in the next 3 months. 

# Battery Hero

This is a **3D 3D PvE FPS Shooter** with the objective of keeping the in-game electricity charge up.
The mimics spawning, suck out the electricity in the room and your objective is to shoot them, hence stealing
their orange orbs which can then be used to recharge the electricity through the generator. It's a mini-game based
on the Final Fantasy 12 Barheim Passage Dungeon.
